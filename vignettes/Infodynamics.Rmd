# Introduction

This vignette tries to demonstrate the use of Infodynamics for exploratory analysis of classification performance in Machine Learning. Infodynamics is an analogue of Thermodynamics for dealing with quantity of information instead of quantity of energy.

The premise is that if the information related to a random variable, the true class, wants to be "transported" somewhere to the predicted class, then the entropic balances of the true and predicted classes have to satisfy certain requisites.  


# Environment construction

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)     # That infamous Mr. Wickham!
library(tidyr)     # Tidying tall & wide dataframes
library(infotheo)  # The functionality provided by this has to be rerouted through entropies
library(entropies) # This package
library(ggtern)    # Excellent package for ternary diagrams in the gg tradition
library(vcd)       # Categorical benchmarks
library(mlbench)   # ml benchmarkss
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = 'pdf') # plots in pdf, better for publication
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment=NA, fig.width=6, fig.height=6)
```
